<!-- In JavaScript, Execution Context is the environment where code runs. It has two main types:

Global Execution Context (GEC) – Created when the script starts, and this refers to the global object (window in browsers).
Function Execution Context (FEC) – Created whenever a function is called.
Each execution context has:

Memory Creation Phase (Variables and functions are stored in memory).
Execution Phase (Code runs line by line).
JavaScript uses the Call Stack to manage execution contexts. -->

//CALL STACK 
<!-- The Call Stack in JavaScript is a data structure that manages function execution.

How it works:
When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack.
When the function finishes, it is popped off the stack.
JavaScript runs functions one at a time (synchronous execution). -->
