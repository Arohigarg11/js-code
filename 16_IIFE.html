<!-- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is used in JavaScript to:

Avoid Global Scope Pollution – Variables inside an IIFE don’t affect the global scope.
Execute Code Immediately – Runs as soon as it's defined.
Create a Private Scope – Keeps variables safe from being accessed or modified outside. -->

// The function is wrapped in parentheses (function() {...}) to make it an expression.
